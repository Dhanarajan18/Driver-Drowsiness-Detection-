# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-
Driver fatigue is one of the leading causes of road accidents. This project presents a real-time drowsiness detection system using OpenCV and Dlib that monitors driversâ€™ eye closure and yawning patterns to prevent accidents. By leveraging computer vision and machine learning techniques, the system provides non-intrusive, cost-effective, and accurate detection in diverse driving conditions.

When drowsiness is detected (e.g., prolonged eye closure or yawning), the system triggers real-time audio-visual alerts, ensuring enhanced driver safety.
